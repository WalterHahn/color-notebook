# color-notebook

A javascript application that generates random colors.

# Objective

I created [javascript-app](https://github.com/WalterHahn/javascript-app), a template to jumpstart javascript application development. This is an example application and an exploratory search for missing features.

## Build

**color-notebook** is being bundled with webpack. Run `npm run build` to compile production ready files and `npm run watch` during development to automatically compile on file change.

## Usage

Open `dist/index.html` in your browser.

## Test

**color-notebook** uses the Jest testing framework. Run `npm test` to execute all tests.
